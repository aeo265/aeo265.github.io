					<h3>Experience</h3>
					<p>Dah Matrix<br>I don't know what's going on in the third one. I mean I knew what was going on but it started getting a bit preachy if you know what I mean.</p>
			
					<p>Matrix<br>This one was amazing. I mean it clearly was based off of Ghost In The Shell, which is a great movie by the way, but it was so different from anything that had come in a whil</p>
			
					<p>Dah M<br>The second one was okay. I mean I think I would rather watch the third film because it was more action and the second one was mostly talking. I mean it had some good scenes, like the line "what if I can't, What if I fail" or something like that.</p>
			
					<p>Matrix<br>But seriously though. Go watch Ghost In The Shell. It's an anime and while it's clearly not an exact copy, you can clearly tell the influence.</p>
			
					<p>what??<br>It definitely takes a few watches or least dedicated time to give you're full attention. When I watched it the first time I was admittedly inebreated (did I spell that right?) second time 100% sober and was a great watch.</p>
			
					<p>Meh idc anymore<br>Also pretty sure the Wachoski? brothers stole that script for the matrix. I mean look at the difference in storytelling and how poorly their movies have done since then. I mean I'm not the smartest person ever but come on. There is definitely something fishy goin on there.</p>
